# dune-classification
Pattern recognition algorithms for the classification of reconstructed particles for the DUNE experiment.

The project can be summarised as having 2 aims:

1) Developing algorithms to distinguish between track-like and shower-like particles, using a multi-variate approach.
2) To classify each event in terms of its interaction type using deep learning.

Code developed by Murtaza Dhanerawala & Redouane Daoud as part of a 3rd year project.
Supervised by Prof John Marshall of the EPP group at the University of Warwick.
